    <h1>History of the Abby</h1>
    <h2>Historical Landmark</h2>
    <h2>Located in the Village Center</h2>
    <h2>10 minute drive From Ennis/Shannon</h2>
    <br>

    <p> <strong> FINGHIN'S CHURCH</strong> was built between 1278 and 1285. This long, rectangular ruin is on the far
        side of the
        River Rine from Quin Abbey. Its main features are the remains of a richly moulded window in the south wall and a
        thirteen-foot-wide opening in the east-gable window.
        A square tower about fifty-six feet in height was later built at the south-eastern angle with the door opening
        into the church. According to tradition, the church was dedicated to St. Finghin, but by 1839, John O'Donovan
        was unable to discover which St. Finghin it commemorated or even which holy day had been kept in his honour.
        No part of the church appeared older than the fifteenth century to him.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <strong> QUIN CASTLE</strong> was built in 1280 by Thomas de Clare in an attempt to subdue the MacNamaras. This
        was a massive
        Norman castle with large rounded towers at each corner. This strong-walled keep was reduced to a hideous
        blackened ruin six years later when Cuvea MacNamara avenged the death of an O'Liddy chieftain who had been
        killed by the Norman garrison. He attacked, ransacked and burned the castle, slaying most of the defenders.
        Parts of the castle towers still remain at the south-east, south-west and north-east corners of the abbey. Part
        of the vanished north-west tower, or at least its site, can still be discovered. Much of the remaining castle
        walls were incorporated into the abbey's south and east walls. A fragment to the north-east, close to the tower
        base, shows how sturdily built the thirteenth-century castle had been. From the fourteenth century onward the
        MacNamaras were the most powerful family in the baronies of Upper and Lower Bunratty and Upper and Lower Tulla.
        By 1578 they owned forty two castles scattered over the entire area of those baronies.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <strong>QUIN ABBEY</strong> was founded by the MacNamaras around 1350. Using the solid south curtain-wall of the
        old castle,
        they
        built a church from east to west. North of the church they erected a residence for the clergy and a small
        sacristy. Sioda Cam MacNamara built the cloisters in 1402. The bell-tower and Lady Chapel were erected by
        Mahon
        MacNamara in 1430. Three years later he sponsored the Franciscan friars and allowed them to establish their
        friary in Quin. The abbey was officially suppressed in 1541 and became O'Brien property in 1547. The
        O'Briens,
        however, allowed the friars to continue living there. By 1548 it had fallen into disrepair and was described
        as
        "one great church, now ruinous, covered with slate, and a steeple greatly decayed".

        In 1584 Sir John Perrot had Donough Beg O'Brien half-hanged from a cart, his bones broken with the back of
        an
        axe, and hung, still alive, on the steeple of Quin Abbey. The English forces maintained a barracks in the
        abbey
        until a namesake of Donough's burned it over their heads. The MacNamaras, with some help from other families
        in
        the district, repaired the church. The walls had suffered very little damage due to their firmness. By 1604
        the
        choir and Lady Chapel had been roofed over and the ground-floor apartments made habitable. In 1617 the Irish
        Franciscan Provincial, Fr Donough Mooney, noted the repairs and commented on the two or three friars then in
        possession as being "old, helpless men with scarcely a memory of the pre-suppression friary". They told him
        that
        the altar plate of gold and silver had been given to one of the MacNamaras of Knappogue for safekeeping.
        Unfortunately, MacNamara died before he could divulge the whereabouts of the abbey's altar plate. The
        Cromwellians broke into the friary and desecrated it in 1651. They shot and beheaded Fr. Rory MacNamara and
        hanged Fr. Donald Mac Clancy and Br. Dermot MacInerney. By 1667 the Franciscans had returned. Fr. Moriarty
        O'Griffin was named as the guardian in 1670. A few years later, in 1681, the abbey was reported empty, but
        the
        friars had returned again by 1691 when the cavalry of the defeated Irish army camped around the walls. The
        friars were expelled again by Colonels William and Henry Stamer some time before 1760 but remained in the
        townland of Drim, a few miles away. One friar, however, continued to live in the abbey ruins. Other friars
        succeeded him. The last friar of Quin was Fr. John Hogan of Drim. He died in 1820. His tombstone lies at the
        north-east corner of the cloister walk. Sixty years after his death the Board of Public Works took over the
        abbey as a national monument.

    <br>
    <p><strong>THE LADY CHAPEL</strong> is the last resting place of John "Fireball" MacNamara. He was the last of the
        MacNamara
        chieftains, a direct descendant of the men who built this abbey. They too were buried here. The best preserved
        of the MacNamara tombs is the one north-east of the choir. The Latin inscription along the edge of the covering
        slab beneath the carved stone canopy may be translated as follows: "Here lie Hugh, who was the son of Laurence,
        who was the son of Matthew MacNamara, and Couleen MacNamara his wife, who caused me to be made". This tomb was
        built around 1450. Inserted under the canopy is another slab which states that Captain Teigue MacNamara repaired
        the tomb in 1714.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <strong>THE TOWER</strong> can be reached by following the gulley walk that leads from the west wall of the
        dormitory. The view
        from the top of the tower is most impressive and well worth the climb up the narrow spiral staircase. The
        cloister is one of the abbey's finest features. The most unusual feature is the lavabo, or medieval toilet. It
        is located in a tower to the north of the main complex. This, in turn, is linked to the old dormitory by a
        connecting passage over an archway which joins the two structures. There is an opening in the lower part of the
        tower from which material for compost may have been taken in olden times.

    <h1>Myths and Tales</h1>

    <h2>Period 1318-1500</h2>
    <p>
        Popular guide-books always follow the ‘Four Masters’ in attributing the Franciscan convent of Quin to Sioda
        MacNamara in 1402. It was certainly largely rebuilt and ornamented at that time, but the many earlier features
        show that Wadding is right in placing its foundation before 1350. The fact that it was built on and out of the
        ruins of a great castle was noted by Sir Thomas Deane in 1884.[96] I first identified the castle,—which he
        attributed to Brian Boru, but which is an unmistakably Norman court, with great circular turrets at three
        angles,—with the ‘round-towery, strong castle’ built by Thomas de Clare in 1280 at Cuinche. It is likely that
        the MacNamaras, after the fall of Bunratty in 1334 and before 1350, gave its site, as a thankoffering for their
        victory, to God and the monks of St. Francis, so I shall place the legends of the ‘Abbey’ in this period.
        Tradition near Tulla points to some enclosures, a little over a mile from the village and in low ground at the
        foot of ‘Abbey Hill,’ as the place where ‘the MacNamaras began to build Quin Abbey.’ The quarry from which its
        stones were drawn is shown on the hillside. At Quin it is said to have been built by the Gobbán saor, the famous
        legendary Master Builder, to whom so many Round Towers, churches, castles, and abbeys of the ninth to the
        fifteenth centuries are attributed. He twisted the spiral pillars in its beautiful cloister with his own hands.
        One of the builders fell from the roof and was killed, where an ancient tombstone, with an axe incised on it,
        marks the place of his burial. Several traditions are told about Sioda, near Kilkishen. He was said to have
        caught a water horse, and, after being ridden for many years, it ran away with him one day, dinting a rock with
        its hoofs as it sprang, with the chieftain on its back, into Cullaunyheeda Lake, thence called after his name
        ‘Heeda.' Another tale says that Sioda was not drowned, but sleeps beneath the waters, not to waken until
        summoned to the final battle for the independence of Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
        The peel towers rising so numerously in the country mostly date from about 1430 to 1480. Tradition attributes
        Rossroe Castle to Sioda MacNamara, who built Quin Abbey in 1402. Danganbrack and Ballymarkahan are also rightly
        assigned to the MacNamaras, after Quin Abbey was erected, as I was told about Ballymarkahan in 1906. Near
        Clonlara seven brothers built ‘seven’ castles ‘against each other,’ and were ‘all’ killed by their brothers. I
        heard the story first in 1868, when a mere child, and think that there was a princess or a beautiful lady in it
        about whom the brothers quarrelled, but I barely recollect it, and in 1889 could not recover more than ‘the
        seven brothers who killed each other.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps to this period should be attributed the tale of a certain monk of Ennis ‘Abbey’ trying to cross the
        Fergus during a flood. The current being too strong, he called to some men to help him over, but they refused,
        and he cursed Ennis that no man of Ennis should ever be able to do any good for the place.
    </p>
    <p>
        The monks of Ennis told in the seventeenth century how Conor ‘Nasatus’ (i.e. Conchobhar na Srona) O’Brien,
        Prince of Thomond from 1466, was on his death in 1496 seized by devils. Brother Fergal O’Trean, a man of holy
        life, when he saw them carrying off the prince, prayed earnestly for him, and that very hour a holy hermit at
        Lismore, where no one had heard of Conor’s death, announced that the prince’s soul was saved by the prayers of a
        holy monk at Ennis.
    </p>

    <h2>O’Quin and the Swan-Maiden</h2>
    <p>
        The fullest and most beautiful of the Clare folk-tales is connected in its most popular versions with Tyge Ahood
        (i.e. Tadgh an Comhad) O’Brien, Prince of Thomond, who reigned from 1461-6. But it is not of his time, nor
        indeed of any historic time, but a local version of a world-wide myth. The Inchiquin legend was first
        published by Dr. G. Petrie in 1840, and then in ‘Memorials of Adare’ by Lord Dunraven, who claimed descent from
        the O’Quins of Inchiquin. 1 The best and fullest modern version is given by Dr. G. U. MacNamara, whose
        fields run down to the lake and have in view the castle of Inchiquin and the church of Coad. The ‘Ordnance
        Survey Letters’ give a recension of the same date as Petrie’s. I may add that the power of the O’Quins as a
        tribe was really broken long before 1460, in the opinion of some several generations before the Norman invasion,
        and in that of others as late as 1180. But at any rate the O’Quins were of good standing down to the Norman
        invasion. Edaom, daughter of O’Quin and Queen of Munster, died on a pilgrimage to Derry in 1188. The ‘Cathreim
        Thoirdhealbhaigh’ barely mentions the family as fighting at Corcomroe in 1317, when Mathgamhan O’Brien held
        Inchiquin and its island castle.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1839 the tale was located at the rock platform, at the upper end of the lake, called Doonaun, or, at that
        time, Duneán ui chuinn (‘O’Quin’s rock fort’).Conor O’Quin, the chief, walking by the lake, saw a lovely
        woman on the south shore, combing her hair. She vanished on his approach. This happened three times. O’Quin was
        consumed with love for her, and at last, seeing her take off a dark hood, he succeeded in stealing upon her and
        catching up the hood so that she could not escape. He seized her ‘without even saying ‘your servant, ma’am!’ or
        any other decent good-morrow,’ and asked her to be his wife. She consented, and they were married and lived most
        happily for several years. At last O’Brien of Lemeneagh and others got up races at Coad, and O’Quin went to
        them, after promising his wife not to invite any guest nor to accept any man’s invitation. He forgot his
        promise, asked O’Brien back to a sumptuous feast, and played cards with him. His wife took her hood, stole out,
        and disappeared. O’Quin staked all he had on the cards, and lost. He lived on, a lonely and miserable man, as a
        dependent of O’Brien, who allowed him to dwell in ‘de Clare’s Court’ or ‘O’Quin’s Ruin’ on the Fergus just above
        the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
        Petrie tells how a young chief of the O’Quins saw a number of lovely swans sporting on the western shore of the
        lake. He caught one and brought it to his home, where to his amazement it threw off its downy covering and
        appeared as a maid of the greatest beauty. Madly in love he proposed marriage, and she accepted him on the three
        conditions that the marriage should be kept a secret, he should never ask O’Brien to his house, and
        he should avoid all games of chance. Some happy years passed by, and brought two children. Then there were races
        at Coad, O’Quin asked some O’Briens to his house, and his wife after preparing the feast resumed her swan dress,
        wept over her children, and plunged into the lake. O’Quin, ignorant of his loss, commenced gambling, and lost
        all his property to ‘Tiege an cood O’Brien,’ the most distinguished of his guests. Petrie is inclined to
        rationalize the tale, and to suppose that, in consequence of the chief’s concealed and probably lowly marriage,
        the tribe repudiated him, pointing out that the O’Quin pedigree given by MacFirbis breaks off about 1460. But
        the widespread occurrence of the tale does not favour a local source, although it may have been locally adapted
        with that love for definite topographical and historic setting so characteristic of the Irish.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. MacNamara took pains to get the best modern recension, so I give this in preference to my own scanty notes
        made in 1884 at Kilnaboy.The young chief of Clan Ifearnain was hunting deer on Keentlae, and in his eager
        pursuit of a stag got parted from his companions. As he wandered along the shore of the lake he saw five
        beautiful swans playing in the water. They came ashore, took off their plumage, and became maidens of exquisite
        beauty. After a moment’s amazement he ran out. They threw on their feathered robes,—all save one,—and flew away.
        O’Quin had seized one dress, and the four other swans, with plaintive cries, disappeared, leaving their sister
        weeping. O’Quin led her back to his castle, comforted her, and won her love. But she asked two pledges before
        her marriage,—that it should be kept a secret, and that no O’Brien should be admitted under their roof. Seven
        years passed by, the pair and their two beautiful children living in ever-increasing happiness. Then, one fatal
        day, there were races at Coad, and O’Quin met Teigue an chomad O’Brien, brought him home, drank freely,
        commenced gambling, and lost all his lands and property. The ruined man rushed to his only remaining possession,
        his wife and children, but to his horror found his wife in her swan dress with a cygnet held under each wing.
        She gave him one look of sorrowful reproach, flew out over the misty lake, and disappeared forever.
