# The Quin Abbey 
**The Quin Abbey** is a old Friary in Quin Village County Clare. I have picked this location because of its history and made a responsive website for it where you can see a 360 video of the Abbey on the home page, there is a about page with history, facts and myths of the Abbey. I have also Added a Gallery with many photos of outside and inside of the Abbey. On the contact page it has Opening times, the location and a form to book a tour guide.
