# The Quin Abbey 
**The Quin Abbey** is a old Friary in Quin Village County Clare. I have picked this location because of its history and made a responsive website for it where you can see a 360 video of the Abbey on the home page and there is an about page with history, facts and myths of the Abbey. I have also added a gallery with many photos of the outside and inside of the Abbey. On the contact page it has opening times, the location and a form to book a tour guide.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

 ![Color-scheme](./assets/images/colour-scheme-rm.png)
 The primary colour is grey (rbg 128, 128, 128,) it is on the background of the about page and the gallery page. I picked grey because although it is a tourist attraction and a historic site, it is also a graveyard and I wanted to be respectful while making the site.
 
 I used whitesmoke (rgb 255, 255, 255) for the links in the nav.
  
 I used red (rgb 255, 0, 0,) for the hover effect on the nav, footer, phone number link and the email link.
   
 I used white (rgb 245, 245, 245) for the footer icons. I used black for the main content on the about page, footer headings and the border and shadow around the images in the gallery.


## Typography 
  I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the following fonts to the site

* The 'Libre Baskerville' font is used on the logo for the site.
   * ![Libre Baskerville](./assets/images/libre-font-rm.png)

* The 'Karla' font is used for all headlings like the Footer, About page, Form and the Form Confirmation page.
   * I also used 'Karla' for the paragraphs in the sign up form.
   * ![Karla](./assets/images/karla-font-rm.png)

* The 'Merriweather' font is used for the Nav, Home page information, About page paragraphs, Confirmation page paragraphs, and the Form label.
   * ![Merriweather](./assets/images/merriweather-font-rm.png)

* The 'Satisfy' font is used for the Opening times and Contact information.
   * ![Satisfy](./assets/images/satisfy-font-rm.png)   


## Imagery
All images were taken by myself.
The 360 ariel video was found on youtube and I edited it to take the sound off and make it shorter to fit into the background.

## Wireframes
* This a wireframe of my Home page.
  * ![Wireframe-1](./assets/images/bas-wireframe-1.png)

* This a wireframe of my About page.
  * ![Wireframe-2](./assets/images/bas-wireframe-2.png)

  * ![Wireframe-3](./assets/images/bas-wireframe-3.png)

* This a wireframe of my Contact page.  
  * ![Wireframe-4](./assets/images/bas-wireframe-4.png)

# Credits

## Code Used
  * For my Gallery I found a grid system on [W3 Schools gallery image grid](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_grid_responsive.asp).

  * For my form I used [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLxA9froMOs) video on how to make form. I was not happy with it and the tips and style I got from Web Dev made it look a lot nicer on my page.

  * I learned how to insert a video into the background from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ITxSzjZUc&list=PLQ3vyzwXGsgJnHHoW2Y_JgheqF4o9HMfR&index=17&t=466s). I had my video linked with a Iframe on my page but having it in the background looks a lot nicer.

  * For the button that brings you back to the top of the page I followed a video from [Dark Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vef9bxTilCU&t=11s).

## Content
 * I learned how to use flex box from three sources.
   * [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
   * [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell).
   * [Web Dev simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified).

 * All information in my About page was taken from the [Clare County Libary](https://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/places/quininterest.htm).

 * I learned how to make a header and footer from two sources.
   * [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell).
   * [Web Dev simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified).

 * I have to give a huge thank you to [Kera](https://github.com/kera-cudmore) for the template of the README and all the tips that came with it.
    

## Media
 * All photos have been taken and edited by myself.
 * I got the video on the home page off youtube I could not email the owner to ask for permission but I left a comment underneath asking for permission. [Orignal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EgQBH_0Ppc).
